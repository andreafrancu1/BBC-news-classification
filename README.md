This project is a part of a Kaggle Competition: BBC News Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview) that uses both supervised and unsupervised methods to predict the topic of various BBC news articles. The different models are then compared and the one with the highest accuracy score is used to create a solution that will then be submitted to the Kaggle competition.
